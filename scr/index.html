    <h1>Antoine de Saint Exupéry - The little prince</h1>
    <p>TO LEON WERTH</p>
    <p>
      I ask the indulgence of the children who may read this book for dedicating
      it to a grown-up. I have a serious reason: he is the best friend I have in
      the world. I have another reason: this grown-up understands everything,
      even books about children. I have a third reason: he lives in France where
      he is hungry and cold. He needs cheering up. If all these reasons are not
      enough, I will dedicate the book to the child from whom this grown-up
      grew. All grown-ups were once children - although few of them remember it.
      And so I correct my dedication:
    </p>

      Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book,
      called True Stories from Nature, about the primeval forest. It was a
      picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal. Here is a
      copy of the drawing.

      In the book it said:
      <em
        >"Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it. After
        that they are not able to move, and they sleep through the six months
        that they need for digestion."</em
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle. And after some
      work with a colored pencil I succeeded in making my first drawing. My
      Drawing Number One. It looked something like this:
